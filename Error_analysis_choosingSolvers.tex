\section{Error analysis and on choosing ODE solvers}
\label{sec4}
%%-----------
In this section, we will give error bounds and discuss how to choose ODE
solvers for solving modified differential equations arising in the above mentioned
MTS algorithms.
The main aim is to obtain resulted approximations which should have the same order of accuracy as the considered
exponential integrators.

For the local error analysis of scheme \eqref{eq4}, we consider one step with initial value $\tilde{u}_n=u(t_n)$ on the exact solution, i.e.
\begin{subequations} \label{eq5.1}
\begin{align}
 U_{n,i}&= \ee^{c_i h A}u_n +h \sum_{j=1}^{s}a_{ij}(h A) g(t_n +c_j h, U_{n,j}), \q  1\leq i\leq s,  \label{eq5.1a} \\
u_{n+1} &= \ee^{h A}u_n +  h \sum_{i=1}^{s}b_{i}(h A)g(t_n +c_i h, U_{n,i}).  \label{eq5.1b} 
\end{align} 
\end{subequations}
Let $\tilde{e}_{n+1}=\hat{u}_{n+1}- \tilde{u}_{n+1}$
denote the local error, i.e., the difference between the numerical solution $\hat{u}_{n+1}$ after one step starting
from $\tilde{u}_{n}$ and the corresponding exact solution of \eqref{eq1} at $t_{n+1}$.
