The aim of this work is to construct efficient multiple time stepping (MTS) algorithms based on various important classes of explicit one-step exponential integrators. More precisely, starting from explicit exponential Runge--Kutta methods, we derive such algorithms which can be interpreted as particular implementations of these integrators. The proposed approach can be applied to the exponential Rosenbrock methods.  
 In contrast to the well-known MTS techniques in the literature which are inspired by multistep methods, our new algorithms do not require a computation of starting values and easily perform an adaptive time step control. Another great advantage of these algorithms compared to the standard implementations of exponential integrators is that they can avoid matrix functions. 
The efficiency of the new algorithms  and the resulting MTS schemes with order of accuracy up to four is illustrated on some numerical examples.
